This project was made with the help of Cursor Ai to create a professional working website to act as a project portfolio. 
The project was built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
Working with said code it established a working website to present my projects over time, with usefull headings and sections tat give readers a clear understanding of the text
Also with the use of CSS it made everything look professional and appealing.
